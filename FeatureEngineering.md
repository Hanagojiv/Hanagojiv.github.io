## Introduction
The World Happiness Report ranks countries based on their happiness levels, influenced by factors like economic production, social support, and life expectancy. This project leverages this data to understand and predict happiness scores effectively.


# Detailed Project Documentation

## Data Description üìä
The dataset for this project comes from the 2015 World Happiness Report, which includes happiness scores and related metrics from various countries. Key features analyzed include GDP per capita, which reflects economic output; family dynamics, indicating social support structures; health metrics, gauging life expectancy; freedom levels, assessing citizens' autonomy to make life choices; and perceptions of corruption, which impact societal trust. These factors are pivotal in understanding what contributes to national happiness, providing a comprehensive dataset for exploring the nuances of societal well-being.

## Data Cleaning üßπ
To ensure the integrity and quality of our analysis, we undertook rigorous data cleaning processes:
- **Checking Missing Values**: We meticulously checked for missing entries across the dataset. The absence of missing values confirmed the robustness of our data, allowing for more reliable and accurate analyses.
- **Outlier Detection and Handling**: Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, we identified and addressed outliers in the dataset. This step was crucial to maintaining statistical integrity and ensuring that our findings were representative of general trends rather than skewed by extreme values.

## Feature Selection üîç
We employed a suite of sophisticated feature selection techniques to pinpoint the most impactful predictors of happiness:
- **Correlation Analysis**: By utilizing heatmaps, we visualized the interdependencies between features, which helped us understand and address multicollinearity, ensuring that our model's performance was not hindered by redundant information.
- **Random Forest Importance**: This method allowed us to evaluate the significance of each predictor based on how much it improved the model's accuracy, giving us a clear indication of which features were most influential.
- **Backward Elimination**: We methodically removed features with nonsignificant p-values through backward elimination, focusing on a refined set of variables that significantly impacted the model's predictive power.

## Model Optimization üõ†Ô∏è
Following feature selection, we optimized our forecasting model to enhance its performance and usability:
- **Reducing Complexity**: By stripping away less impactful features, we reduced model complexity, which not only improved interpretability but also enhanced generalization by preventing overfitting.
- **Model Comparison**: We rigorously tested various models to identify the top performer based on simplicity and accuracy, ensuring that our chosen model provided the best balance between usability and predictive power.

## Results üìà
Our refined model demonstrated superior performance, with significant improvements in accuracy when predicting happiness scores. This success underscores the effectiveness of our data cleaning, feature selection, and model optimization strategies, highlighting how methodical preparations can lead to substantial gains in model performance.

## Conclusion üéØ
This project showcases the crucial role of meticulous data management and strategic analysis in enhancing the performance of predictive models. By concentrating on significant predictors and streamlining our model, we achieved not only higher accuracy but also greater interpretability, which is essential for practical applications of machine learning in social sciences.

## Future Work üîÆ
- **Incorporate More Data**: To build on our current findings, we plan to expand the dataset to include more recent years and additional countries, providing a broader base for analysis and comparison.
- **Explore Advanced Models**: We aim to apply more complex algorithms, such as XGBoost or neural networks, to potentially boost the model's accuracy and robustness.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Developing a system for real-time happiness prediction using live data streams could significantly enhance decision-making processes in policy and business contexts.
