## Data Science Projects ðŸ”§

### Generating Fake Images using GAN
_Nov 2023 â€“ Dec 2023_
- Model Design and Tools: Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to construct and train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a detailed generator and discriminator architecture, aiming to generate realistic human face images.
- Dataset and Preprocessing: Employed a face-mask-lite dataset containing 9,090 images, preprocessed using OpenCV for color correction and resizing, followed by transformation into tensor slices for efficient batch processing during training.
- Training and Results: Over multiple training epochs, refined the generator's ability to produce convincing face images, achieving increasingly realistic results as evidenced by discriminator feedback, which assessed the artificial images' similarity to genuine data distributions.
